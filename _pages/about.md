Welcome to my homepage!

I am an assistant professor in the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
---
Distributed optimization, machine learning, networked multi-agent systems.

Recruitment
---
I am always looking for self-motivated students with solid mathematical background and research interests in optimization, machine learning, distributed algorithms, game theory, etc.
