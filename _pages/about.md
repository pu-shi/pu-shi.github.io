Welcome! I am an assistant professor in the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
---
Distributed optimization, machine learning, multi-agent networks.

See [here](https://pu-shi.github.io/lab/) for our research topics, and [here](https://pu-shi.github.io/publications/) for our publications.

Openings
---
We are always looking for self-motivated students with solid mathematical background and research interests in optimization, machine learning, distributed algorithms, game theory, etc. Some info can be found [here](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-794054-1-1.html) (in Chinese).
