In 2012, I received a B.S. Degree in Engineering Mechanics from Peking University. In 2016, I received a Ph.D. Degree in Systems Engineering from the University of Virginia (advisor: [Alfredo Garcia](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/profiles/garcia-alfredo.html)). I was a postdoc at the University of Florida from 2016 to 2017 (advisor: [Alfredo Garcia](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/profiles/garcia-alfredo.html)), a postdoc at Arizona State University from 2017 to 2018 (advisor: [Angelia NediÄ‡](https://angelia.engineering.asu.edu/)), and a postdoc in the Division of Systems Engineering at Boston University from 2018 to 2019  (advisors: [Alex Olshevsky](https://sites.bu.edu/aolshevsky/) and [Yannis Paschalidis](https://sites.bu.edu/paschalidis/people/yannis-paschalidis/)). 

Since September 2019, I have been an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. From 2019 to 2020, I was with The Institute for Data and Decision Analytics (iDDA), which was then merged into [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/). My research has been funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data (SRIBD), Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS), and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program.

I enjoy playing soccer, table tennis, badminton and other fun sports.
