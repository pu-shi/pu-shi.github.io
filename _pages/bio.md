I was born in Chuzhou, Anhui, China. In 2012, I received a B.S. Degree in Engineering Mechanics from Peking University. In 2016, I received a Ph.D. Degree in Systems Engineering from the University of Virginia (advisor: [Alfredo Garcia](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/profiles/garcia-alfredo.html)). I was a postdoc at the University of Florida from 2016 to 2017 (advisor: [Alfredo Garcia](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/profiles/garcia-alfredo.html)), a postdoc at Arizona State University from 2017 to 2018 (advisor: [Angelia NediÄ‡](https://angelia.engineering.asu.edu/)), and a postdoc in the Division of Systems Engineering at Boston University from 2018 to 2019  (advisors: [Alex Olshevsky](https://sites.bu.edu/aolshevsky/) and [Yannis Paschalidis](https://sites.bu.edu/paschalidis/people/yannis-paschalidis/)). 

Since September 2019, I have been an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. From 2019 to 2020, I was with The Institute for Data and Decision Analytics (iDDA), which was then merged into the newly established [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/).
