In the Multi-Agent Learning and Optimization (MALO) Lab, we study distributed algorithms for learning and optimization over multi-agent networks.
Specifically, we design the rules followed by a group of autonomous agents, each with *local information*, collaborate to achieve a global objective through *local computation* and *local communication*.
Our research is interdisciplinary in nature that spans several areas, including network science, optimization, control theory, and machine learning.


Applications include large-scale distributed machine learning, multi-robot coordination, decentralized estimation, among others.
