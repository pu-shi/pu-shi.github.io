In the Multi-Agent Learning and Optimization (MALO) Lab, we studying distributed algorithms for learning and optimization over multi-agent networks.
Recently, I have focused on designing novel distributed optimization algorithms for problems with uncertainties (stochastic optimization) and general network topologies (directed graphs).
