In the Multi-Agent Learning and Optimization (MALO) Lab, we study distributed algorithms for learning and optimization over multi-agent networks.
Our research is interdisciplinary and spans several areas, including network science, optimization, control theory, and machine learning.



Applications of our research include large-scale distributed machine learning, multi-robot coordination, decentralized estimation, among others.
