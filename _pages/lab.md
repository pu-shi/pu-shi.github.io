In the Multi-Agent Learning and Optimization (MALO) Lab, we study distributed algorithms for learning and optimization over multi-agent networks.
Specifically, we design the rules for a group of autonomous agents, each with **local information**, to collaboratively achieve a global objective through **local computation** and **local communication**. Applications of our research include large-scale distributed machine learning, resource allocation in networks, multi-robot coordination, decentralized estimation, among others.
Our research is interdisciplinary in nature and spans several areas, including **network science**, **optimization**, **control theory**, and **machine learning**.

## Elements of Distributed Learning and Optimization
	
 Problem settings:  
		* Objective functions and constraints: convex vs nonconvex, unconstrained vs constrained, simple vs composite functions.  
		* Network topology: undirected vs directed, time-varying.  
		* Communication: delays, message losses, Byzantine attacks.

Algorithms:  
	* Optimization: (stochastic) gradients, zeroth-order, higher-order, dual methods, ADMM.  
	* Coordination: synchronous, gossip, broadcast, fully asynchronous.  
	* Communication: compression, event-triggered.  
	* Robust to message losses, node failures, etc.
